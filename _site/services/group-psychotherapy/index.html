        <strong>Mondays (12:30pm-2:00pm)</strong>
      </p>
      
      <p>The Next Chapter is that period in life when one is transitioning from work, raising a family, and multiple daily pressures to retirement and enjoying one’s free time at a slower pace. It is also adjusting to an empty nest, an aging body and mind, and finding new purpose and meaning. In this group, the challenges and joys of this phase of life will be discussed along with how maintaining sobriety is critical in the face of significant change and loss. Members will be encouraged to share their own personal experiences of the Next Chapter with the goal of decreasing isolation and developing a strong sense of community.</p>

      </p>
      
      <p>Supportive-Expressive Therapy is an evidence-based treatment for a variety of different presenting problems, including substance use disorders. At Wholeview, we provide a specific manualized form of SET group, based on the Harvard Cocaine Recovery Project. In this approach, a substance use disorder is viewed as an outgrowth of difficulties in four areas; (1) self-esteem; (2) managing feelings; (3) managing relationships; and (4) self-care.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Mondays (6:30PM-7:30PM)</strong>
      </p>
      
      <p>This group integrates motivational interviewing techniques with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). It’s a manualized treatment that consists of 20 sessions covering a variety of topics, including making effective choices and decisions; the pace of change; roadblocks to help; internal and external triggers; family and significant others; and building a recovery environment. The group focuses on increasing internal motivation for making positive change and developing practical skills to aid the recovery process.</p>

      <p>Whether you are ambivalent about making change, or have committed yourself to sobriety, this group will provide a fresh perspective in helping you achieve your ideal relationship with substances. Rooted in therapeutic approaches which help navigate one’s readiness to change, this group intends on ‘meeting you where you are at’. In a secure and collaborative environment, participants will have the opportunity to share openly, and will be encouraged to learn from and to support one another. Through relating with others, and engaging in self-exploration, you may begin to identify how previous patterns in your life have contributed to your present-day experience. Deepening your insights into what brought you to this very moment can empower you to break-through obstacles which may have once seemed daunting or unachievable. The rewards of doing so go far beyond changing one’s relationship with substances; this group aims to support your living an authentic, well-balanced, and meaningful life.</p>

      <h4>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy</h4>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Tuesdays (12:30PM-2:00PM) & Saturdays  (Noon-1:00PM)</strong>
      </p>
      
      <p>We all experience situations we cannot control, behaviors that are hard to change, and intense emotions.  These can be triggers for behaviors (e.g., substance use, isolation) that reduce our ability to function effectively.  This interferes with our ability to engage with what we care about such as family, friends, work, and self-care.  As a result, we become stuck in a cycle of negative behavior that makes it harder and harder to achieve what we want in life.</p>

        <strong>Tuesdays (6:30PM-7:30PM) </strong>
      </p>
      
      <p>Process groups are an opportunity to reflect on patterns of relating.  This includes our relationship to substances, our families, our loved ones, and to the group itself.  This group will focus on identifying feelings experienced in relationships and exploring ways of breaking unhealthy patterns and maintaining healthy ones. We will look at how different contexts in life can impact behavior and how we can begin to alter and change our relationship to these contexts.  This group emphasizes the healing power of relationships among group members and the importance of emotional understanding and attunement. The leader will stimulate the flow of dialogue and guide members in finding healthier ways to fulfill their social and emotional needs and building and in maintaining mutually rewarding and respectful relationships.</p>

      <p>Join other folks in recovery to talk about the role of emotion in recovery. Whether you’re feeling sad or happy, emotions and feelings can be triggers to use. Sometimes you may have mixed emotions about sobriety in general. Together we will learn how to identify emotions, how to separate our sense of self from our thoughts and feelings, and how to manage sobriety in the face of these mixed emotions</p>

      <p>This skill building group is for individuals who are recently abstinent and are seeking support in early recovery. The group  meets for 90 minutes and runs for 12 weeks. The goal of the group is to enhance self-control and raise awareness of problematic thoughts and behaviors and replace them with new more effective thoughts, skills and strategies for maintaining abstinence. Based on a cognitive behavioral model established at Yale University School of Medicine, we focus on topics such as exploring positive and negative consequences of continued use, self-monitoring to recognize craving early on, identifying internal and external triggers, coping with cravings, practicing refusal skills, articulating goals and addressing ambivalence.  Members will have homework to support skills learned in the group meetings. We welcome collaboration with group members’ individual therapists.</p>

      <p>Mentalization is the way that we understand other people’s emotions, thoughts, desires, beliefs, and intentions. Mentalization Based Treatment Group is a therapeutic approach which aims to increase group members’ ability to mentalize using a manual based psychodynamic therapy. This evidence-based approach developed at the Anna Freud Institute in London, is designed to assist people in four main goals: to achieve better behavioral control, to increase affect regulation, to develop more intimate and gratifying relationships and to have the ability to pursue life goals.  In this group, Dr. Sarah Church will begin by sharing the theory of mentalization and how it affects mental health. Group members will be encouraged to work together to increase their capacity to understand fellow group members and to improve their own affect regulation, to strengthen interpersonal relationships, and to reduce problematic and self-harm behaviors including alcohol and drug use.</p>

      <p>Trauma reaches beyond memory and logic. It is stored in the body and can contribute to relapse, discomfort, anger, depression, and self-destructive behavior.  This trauma group will focus on providing supportive resources to manage hypervigilance and traumatic responses, psychoeducation on the neurobiology and physical impact of trauma, opportunities to share trauma experiences with others in a compassionate space, and exercises to move our past experiences from “the here and now” to the “there and then”.</p>

      </p>
      
      <p>Emotion Efficacy Therapy (EET) is an evidenced-based therapeutic approach that is rooted on the premise that emotions are valuable signals that guide our behaviors.  Learning to skillfully navigate these messages is an integral component to living a more well-balanced and fulfilling life. Through cultivating skills in an open and collaborative environment, participants will enhance their capacity to make values-consistent choices. A focus will be placed on exploring ways to achieve your ideal healthy relationship with substances while supporting your goals in various life domains. To accelerate learning, EET involves an experiential component, and session content promotes relaxation techniques, mindfulness approaches, and various coping strategies. Ultimately, developing ‘high-emotion efficacy’ will empower you to live more authentically, intentionally, and with greater meaning and purpose.</p>

      <p>Dr. Michelle Ritz leads this group as a safe space for all folks who identify as women. Recovery is an opportunity to get know yourself intimately and find the space to step into your full self. Too often, gender does not get the attention it deserves. There are unique aspects to the social and emotional experiences of womanhood which deserve considerations within the context of substance use. Research has demonstrated the efficacy of women’s-only groups within addiction treatment.</p>

      <p>Having a queer identity carries with it a series of joys, sorrows, advantages, and disadvantages, confusion, clarity, shame and celebration.  This group will explore and process varied experiences and seek to provide a space to attain an observing distance from these formative experiences.  By exploring these experiences this group will seek to better understand being queer from different contexts that contribute to our sense of self.  It is a chance to explore the need to escape, the need to numb, a fear of intimacy, hopes for the future, and how we move through life with more self-compassion and a stronger connection to others.</p>

She introduces practical skills in the group including communication skills and problem-solving skills. As this group meets on Fridays, she will also review and discuss plans for the weekend to ensure that they are both safe and enjoyable.
